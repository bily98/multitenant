# Multitenant Test

This project was made in ASP.NET Core in .NET 7 and it has an implementation of Multitenant with Routing Strategy.

## Getting Started

Once you get the project on your development machine just check and update (if necessary) the connection strings on the file [appsettings.json](https://github.com/bily98/multitenant/blob/master/Test.Api/appsettings.json).

After that run the project. Migrations should be applied automatically.
